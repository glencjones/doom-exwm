# doom-exwm


The Doom Config is held as an org file, I have tried to add as many relevant files as possible.

At the moment I'd suggest it's working with some additonal libs/func to help place floating frames.

By selecting the window you can with the keyboard move a floating frame to another location. 

Minimal checks are performed as it's very much a work in progress.  Edwina was added to see if it added value.

I have an open opinion at the moment as currently I have 3 navigations std doom, exwm and edwina all as far as I can see doing
the same thing.   I have set up exwm to work both in doom and exwm.  So it's questionable if the maps Edwina  need to be used.

Currently I have created a map using the Doom macros, that is neat when probably not in exwm.

Early days with my Lisp so dont expect too much, I'n sure it will get better.

A rather strange use of ifs to switch in and out sections of the exwm using the term type for testing.  You can find the integration of the 
X windows included, based on the term type I switch on and off exwm.  you could do this on the command line.

Like I say a bit rough first cut, will try to improve documentation as I go.
